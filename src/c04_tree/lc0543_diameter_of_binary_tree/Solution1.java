/**
 * This is the solution of No. 543 problem in the LeetCode,
 * the website of the problem is as follow:
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/
 *
 * The description of problem is as follow:
 * ==========================================================================================================
 * Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree.
 * The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree.
 * This path may or may not pass through the root.
 *
 * Example:
 * Given a binary tree
 *           1
 *          / \
 *         2   3
 *        / \
 *       4   5
 * Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
 *
 * Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.
