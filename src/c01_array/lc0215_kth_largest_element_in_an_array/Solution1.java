/**
 * This is the solution of No. 215 problem in the LeetCode,
 * the website of the problem is as follow:
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/
 *
 * The description of problem is as follow:
 * ==========================================================================================================
 * Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order,
 * not the kth distinct element.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2
 * Output: 5
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6] and k = 4
 * Output: 4
 * Note:
 * You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ array's length.
