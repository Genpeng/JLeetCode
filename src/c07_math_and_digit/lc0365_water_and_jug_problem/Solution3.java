/**
 * This is the solution of No. 365 problem in the LeetCode,
 * the website of the problem is as follow:
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/water-and-jug-problem/
 *
 * The description of problem is as follow:
 * ==========================================================================================================
 * You are given two jugs with capacities x and y litres. There is an infinite amount of water supply available.
 * You need to determine whether it is possible to measure exactly z litres using these two jugs.
 *
 * If z liters of water is measurable, you must have z liters of water contained within one or both buckets by the end.
 *
 * Operations allowed:
 * 1. Fill any of the jugs completely with water.
 * 2. Empty any of the jugs.
 * 3. Pour water from one jug into another till the other jug is completely full or the first jug itself is empty.
 *
 * Example 1: (From the famous "Die Hard" example)
 * Input: x = 3, y = 5, z = 4
 * Output: True
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: x = 2, y = 6, z = 5
 * Output: False
